Scrabble/WWF Assistant

Meant to be used alongside a game of mobile scrabble/wwf

start with an empty board
enter moves manually up to current state
enter hand manually
generate plays + sort by score to get best possible move
(to many to search exhaustively in most cases, but can get smart about search strategy)
